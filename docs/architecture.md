# 🏛️ Nadir-OS Architecture

This document explains the big-picture design of **Nadir-OS**.

---

## 🧩 Core Principles

✅ **Microkernel** — Small, secure core with minimal responsibilities (IPC, scheduling, memory).  
✅ **Modular** — Drivers, filesystems, networking, and services run in user space.  
✅ **Portable** — Designed to run on multiple architectures (x86_64, ARM).  
✅ **Extensible** — Third-party modules and services can plug in easily.

---

## 🔹 **Core Layers**

### 1️⃣ Microkernel
- Handles process scheduling, inter-process communication, and memory management.
- Stays small for security and reliability.

### 2️⃣ Userland Services
- Filesystem drivers, device drivers, networking stack.
- Each runs in user space, isolated from the kernel.

### 3️⃣ Applications & Modules
- Command-line tools, GUI layers (future), third-party drivers.
- Everything above userland is modular and community-driven.

## 🔗 Related Concepts

We’re inspired by:
- Andrew Tanenbaum’s MINIX
- GNU Hurd
- L4 microkernels

## 🔍 Next Steps

✅ Create detailed design specs for each module.  
✅ Build prototypes and test in QEMU.  
✅ Invite feedback and peer review.
