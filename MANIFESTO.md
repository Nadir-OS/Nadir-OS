# 📜 Nadir OS Manifesto

## Why We Exist
Everyone deserves to understand, trust, and control their OS.  
No black boxes. No forced lock-in.

## What We Build
A tiny, composable, reproducible base OS for true digital sovereignty.

✅ Immutable core  
✅ Modular everything  
✅ Zero-trust by design  
✅ Declarative & auditable configs  
✅ AI helps explain & secure  
✅ Local-first, cloud-optional  
✅ Community-governed

## Principles
Humans > Corporations  
Trust = Transparency  
Simplicity Outlives Complexity  
Forks make us stronger

## What We Refuse
No hidden backdoors  
No forced surveillance  
No lock-in  
No corporate gatekeeping

## Our Vision
> “A solid base layer for humans and communities to build, own, and run their digital worlds — forever.”

## Our Call
Join us. Fork it. Remix it.  
A small base. Infinite freedom.
